MERN Deployment in 5 Steps 🚀
A lot of learners told me their biggest blocker is backend + deployment.
So I turned that into a step-by-step roadmap you can follow today.

What’s inside:

1. API design patterns that scale
2. MongoDB Atlas setup (the right way)
3. Env secrets, CORS, and security checklist
4. Local testing that mimics production
5. Deploy like a pro (Vercel/Netlify + Render/Railway)

 bonus: monitoring, logs, and rollback plan

Swipe the deck → and tell me what you want covered next.
Comment your toughest MERN challenge and I’ll make the next post about it.
